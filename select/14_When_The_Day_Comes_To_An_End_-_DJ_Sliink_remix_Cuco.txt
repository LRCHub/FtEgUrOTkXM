Take the time you need to take
Say the words you have to say
'Cause when the day comes to an end
We'll clear the haze up once again
Train your mind to see the light
Ride the wave but don't collide
If it stings then close your eyes
Look away from your device
When you're alone
When you're at home
You're on your own
You're on your own
Take the time you need to take
Say the words you have to say
Take the time you need to take
Say the words you have to say
What I'm feeling, what I'm seeing
What I'm doing and what's moving
Don't you feel it, don't you see it?
Don't you lose it, don't you lose it
What I'm feeling, what I'm seeing
What I'm doing and what's moving
Don't you feel it, don't you see it?
Don't you lose it, don't you lose it
Take the time you need to take
Say the words you have to say
Take the time you need to take
Say the words you have to say
What I'm feeling, what I'm seeing
What I'm doing and what's moving
Don't you feel it, don't you see it?
Don't you lose it, don't you lose it
What I'm feeling, what I'm seeing
What I'm doing and what's moving
Don't you feel it, don't you see it?
Don't you lose it, don't you lose it
Lose it, lose it
Say the words you have to say (Lose it)
Take the time you need to take
Say the words you have to say
What I'm feeling, what I'm seeing
What I'm doing and what's moving
Don't you feel it, don't you see it?
Don't you lose it, don't you lose it

Take the time you need to take
Say the words you have to say
