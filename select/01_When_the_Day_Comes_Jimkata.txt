He was so down and out he was just about broke.
Sitting in the corner stumbling, mumbling, drinking, thinking, singing
About all these broke people. About all these good people.
Living in low spirits. Lift me to higher spirits.
With all of these people tonight. All of these people tonight.

And when the day comes we'll find a place of our own.
It costs so much just to feel like you have a home.
When you feel lost and low and you can't get up again wait till that day comes.
Wait till that day comes.

Walking round with holes in my pockets. I keep on counting just the same.
Its easy to forget about those blessings and the lessons that you learned so long ago.
Trying to feel alive and well. Trying to feel alive and well it's pretty hard sometimes.
Trying to feel alive and well it's pretty hard sometimes.
